## Daphne's Game

This is very much a work in progress. It currently runs on Windows 8/8.1/10 as well as Windows Phone 8.1. There is a bug that causes it to freeze/crash after the initial five levels. There are also some issues with overlapping shapes.

I was inspired by [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/toddler-touch-and-drag/9wzdncrdkdrh](Toddler Touch and Drag) which appears to be abandoned (and does not run on mobile).
